# Community Workshop Misconduct Reporting Guidelines

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to establish clear and consistent guidelines for reporting misconduct within our community. We value a welcoming and inclusive environment where all participants feel safe and respected. This reporting process aims to address any instances of harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate behavior promptly and fairly.

These guidelines are applicable to all members, contributors, and participants within our community. Misconduct includes but is not limited to harassment, bullying, hate speech, discrimination, or any actions that violates the [code of conduct](https://github.com/CommunityWorkshop/WorkshopDownloader/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 1. Reporting Channels

**Notice: Community Workshop uses Discord as the primary communication platform, so it is recommended to join the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wytUnfR3Uz)**. 

Misconduct reports can be submitted through any of the following channels:

1. **Direct Message to Moderators:** Members can privately message the designated moderators or administrators within the [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/wytUnfR3Uz). This method allows individuals to have one-on-one communication with the moderators and share details about the misconduct incident directly. To do this, users can find the usernames or roles of the community moderators and send them a direct message through Discord.

2. **Reporting Channel:**  The Community Workshop community will have a dedicated channel within the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wytUnfR3Uz) called "#report-to-staff." This channel is specifically set up for members to submit their misconduct reports. In this channel, users can describe the incident, provide relevant information, and attach any evidence if necessary.

## 2. Reporting Guidelines

When making a misconduct report, it is essential to provide detailed information to help the moderation team thoroughly assess and address the incident. Please follow these guidelines when submitting a misconduct report:

1. **Be Clear and Objective:** Describe the incident as clearly and objectively as possible. Include specific details such as the date, time, and any relevant context that can help moderators understand the situation better. Avoid using offensive language or personal attacks when describing the incident.
   
2. **Provide Involved Parties:** If known, provide the usernames or any identifying information of the individuals involved in the incident. This information will assist the moderation team in identifying and addressing the parties responsible for the misconduct.

3. **Include Evidence:** Whenever possible, provide evidence to support your report. Screenshots, chat logs, or any other relevant media can be helpful in understanding the context and severity of the misconduct. Please ensure that any evidence submitted does not violate any privacy or data protection laws.

4. **Multiple Reports:** If multiple people witnessed or were affected by the same incident, it is encouraged for all parties involved to submit their reports. This helps the moderation team gather a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and ensures fair handling of the issue. **However please submit the report in the same forum post to allow for better organisation of reports and to avoid spamming the forums with simular reports**

5. **Avoid Retaliation:** Do not engage in any retaliatory actions against the individuals involved in the misconduct. Retaliation is against the community's principles and will be subject to disciplinary action.

6. **Timely Reporting:** Report incidents as soon as possible after they occur. Timely reporting allows the moderation team to address the issue promptly and prevent further escalation.

7. **Remain Respectful:** Use respectful language when submitting your report. Treat others with kindness and empathy, even when reporting incidents of misconduct.

8. **False Reporting:** Filing a false report with malicious intent is not acceptable and may result in disciplinary action against the individual making the false report.

9. **Follow Up:** If you have additional information or updates related to the reported incident, please feel free to provide it to the moderation team to aid in their investigation.

By adhering to these reporting guidelines, members can help ensure a transparent and constructive process for addressing misconduct within the Community Workshop community. The moderation team will review each report thoroughly and take appropriate action in line with the community's guidelines and values.

## 3. Response Time and Acknowledgment

Community Workshop are committed to addressing misconduct reports promptly and providing acknowledgment to the individuals who submit them. Here's how we handle response time and acknowledgment:

1. **Prompt Response:** The moderation team strives to respond to all misconduct reports as quickly as possible. While the exact response time may vary based on the complexity and severity of the incident, we aim to acknowledge each report within 24 to 72 hours (1-3 days) from the time of submission.

2. **Acknowledgment:** Upon receiving a misconduct report, the moderation team will send an acknowledgment message to the individual who submitted the report. This acknowledgment will confirm that the report has been received and is under review.

3. **Investigation Period:** After acknowledgment, the moderation team will thoroughly investigate the incident, which may include reviewing evidence, gathering statements from involved parties, and consulting with other moderators or administrators.

4. **Timely Updates:** Throughout the investigation process, the moderation team will provide timely updates to the individual who submitted the report. These updates will inform the reporter of the progress made and any actions taken to address the misconduct, if applicable.

5. **Privacy Considerations:** While we aim to handle misconduct reports promptly, certain situations may require extra caution to protect the privacy and safety of all parties involved. In such cases, the moderation team will communicate the need for additional time and provide updates accordingly.

6. **Disclosure of Outcomes:** The outcomes of disciplinary actions taken in response to misconduct reports will generally be disclosed publicly. However, if deemed necessary to maintain community safety, general summaries of actions taken may not be shared with the community.

7. **Continuous Improvement:** The Community Workshop community will regularly evaluate its response time and acknowledgment process to ensure it remains efficient and responsive. We value feedback from our members to help us improve this aspect of the reporting system.

8. **Follow Up on Appeals:** In the case of an appeal regarding a disciplinary action taken, the moderation team will respond to the appeal within a reasonable time frame, allowing for a fair and impartial review.

By adhering to these response time and acknowledgment practices, the Community Workshop community aims to demonstrate its commitment to addressing misconduct reports promptly, respecting the privacy of individuals involved, and maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for all community members.

3. **Different Moderator/Administrator Review:** The appeal will be reviewed by a different moderator or administrator who was not involved in the initial investigation or decision-making process. This ensures an unbiased evaluation of the appeal.

4. **Thorough Review:** The moderator or administrator reviewing the appeal will thoroughly examine the original misconduct report, investigation findings, and the actions taken as a result. They will also consider the grounds for the appeal and any supporting evidence submitted.

5. **Consultation (if needed):** In complex cases, the reviewing moderator or administrator may seek input or consultation from other members of the moderation team to ensure a well-rounded perspective.

## 8. No Retaliation

The Community Workshop community is dedicated to fostering an environment built on mutual respect, trust, and inclusivity. As part of our commitment to maintaining a safe and welcoming space, we strictly prohibit any form of retaliation against individuals who make good faith misconduct reports. Retaliation undermines the community's core values and can discourage individuals from coming forward to report incidents of misconduct. Here are additional details on the policy against retaliation:

1. **Definition of Retaliation:** Retaliation is any negative action, behavior, or attitude directed towards an individual who has filed a misconduct report or participated in an investigation. This includes but is not limited to harassment, intimidation, cyberbullying, exclusion, or any other harmful behavior.

2. **Protection of Reporters:** The "Community Workshop" Discord community recognizes the courage it takes to report misconduct incidents, and we are committed to safeguarding the privacy and well-being of those who come forward. We will take any reports of retaliation seriously and address them promptly.

3. **Reporting Retaliation:** Any member who experiences or witnesses retaliation is encouraged to report the incident immediately using the same reporting channels outlined in the "1. Reporting Channels" section. Reports of retaliation will be treated with the same seriousness and attention as misconduct reports.

4. **Disciplinary Actions:** Individuals found to be engaging in retaliation will be subject to appropriate disciplinary actions, which may include warnings, temporary or permanent bans from the community, or other measures as deemed necessary by the moderation team.

5. **Community Unity:** Creating a culture of respect and support is a shared responsibility. All members are encouraged to contribute to a positive atmosphere within the community and actively discourage any form of retaliation.

By adhering to a strict no-retaliation policy, the Community Workshop community aims to ensure that individuals can report misconduct incidents without fear and feel safe in their participation within the community. Upholding this policy helps us maintain a collaborative and constructive environment where all members can thrive and contribute their talents and ideas freely.

Here are additional details on the regular review process:

Members can provide feedback through surveys, anonymous suggestion boxes, or direct communication with moderators and administrators.
