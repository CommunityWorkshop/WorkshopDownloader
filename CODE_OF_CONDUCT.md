# Community Workshop Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of the Community Workshop project pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate..

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement by contacting the project team at our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wytUnfR3Uz). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project team members and community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

## FAQ
<details>
  <summary>Are codes of conduct a mechanism for turning project governance over to “social justice warriors”?</summary>
  Project maintainers are responsible for tailoring and enforcing the codes of conduct that they adopt. A code of conduct does not grant any authority or power to anyone outside of this group. Even if pressure is applied from a third party, such as on social media, the project maintainers alone have the authority to enforce the code of conduct and are under no obligation to bow to external pressure.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What should I do if I have been accused of violating the code of conduct?</summary>
The first step when dealing with accusations of violation of the code of conduct is to deal with it in a professional manner. Do not respond with sarcasm, attack the code of conduct or its enforcement, or the accuser. Calmly focus on the evidence of what happened, work to understand any damage you may have caused, and examine how your intentions may have inadvertently caused harm. The more you demonstrate your willingness to work with the enforcement team as they evaluate the claim, the better. Most importantly, trust the project maintainers to act in a fair and just manner. However, if you *still* believe the accusation is unjust, you can provide your perspective and engage in respectful dialogue with the community administrators to provide reasoning on why you believe the accusation is unjust. We sometimes make mistakes which would otherwise prove your innocence. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Won’t a code of conduct have a negative effect on the end product?</summary>
  There is no evidence that adopting a code of conduct has a negative effect on code quality, but by fostering respect, empathy, and collaboration it can actually *improve* the overall quality of the end product. A code of conduct promotes healthy interactions between the developers and community and encourages diverse perspectives, which often leads to more innovative and robust outcomes.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Won’t this just promote participation for the sake of participation and an end of meritocracy?</summary>
  The code of conduct is not a positive discrimination policy, and it does not include any recommendation on how to recruit or select project participants. It also does not state or imply that any and all contributions should be accepted, regardless of quality or adequacy, based on any personal characteristic of the submitter. By fostering a more cooperative and civil environment, the code of conduct actually creates the opportunity for more people to participate, learn, grow, and improve the quality of their contributions in a positive and supportive environment.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why should my community have to change to accommodate marginalized people?</summary>
  The level of accommodation that the code of conduct implies is not higher than the one that is expected when dealing with peers in other professional settings. It is not about being accommodating to one group, it’s about making all potential contributors feel welcome and safe. By embracing diversity and providing equal opportunities, the community can benefit from a wider range of perspectives and experiences, leading to more innovation and growth.
</details> 

<details>
  <summary>When I code, I just see the code, not the person, so why should I care about this code of conduct? Can’t minorities keep their minority-status to themselves and focus on the code?</summary>
  If a potential contributor has to hide some portion of their identity in order to avoid explicit or implicit bias, they may not feel safe contributing to the project. Each person should feel welcomed and accepted and free to bring their whole selves to their work. What’s more, hiding behind an anonymous account, a gender- or racial-neutral pseudonym, or otherwise hiding one’s true identity can have a materially negative effect on building the kind of reputation and open source track record that many employers look for in potential hires. Recognizing and respecting the individuals behind the code is essential for fostering a healthy and inclusive community. By following the code of conduct, you contribute to creating an environment where everyone can participate without fear of discrimination or harassment. Valuing and acknowledging the diverse backgrounds and identities of contributors enriches the community as a whole.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Isn’t this just a way for progressive/left-wing people to push their agenda?</summary>
  Codes of conduct are not about promoting any specific political agenda. They are intended to establish guidelines for respectful and inclusive behavior within a project or community. The focus is on creating an environment that is welcoming to all participants, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations. Civil, non-discriminatory, and professional behavior should be a baseline and shared value held by people of all ideologies, regardless of political affiliation (with the obvious exception of hate groups).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Doesn’t adopting a code of conduct make a contributor subject to removal from a project for a simple mistake, holding an unpopular belief, or sharing an opinion on their Twitter account?</summary>
  In the case of a confirmed violation, project maintainers are expected to meet the violation with a consequence that is proportional to the offense and to work with the offender to prevent future violations. Maintainers want a safe, collaborative community of bright, kind, compassionate contributors with solid technical and communication skills. It is not in their best interest to be hostile or overly punitive to members of their community. Codes of conduct are not meant to punish individuals for simple mistakes or unpopular beliefs. They are designed to address behaviors that are harmful, discriminatory, or harass others within the project or community. We consider the context and severity of an incident before taking any enforcement actions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Doesn’t this code of conduct just promote political correctness?</summary>
  Codes of conduct aim to promote respect, inclusivity, and professionalism within a community. While they encourage mindful and considerate communication, they are not solely about political correctness. The focus is on creating a safe and welcoming space where all individuals can participate without fear of harassment or discrimination.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is so wrong that white males dominate a certain profession?</summary>
  Women and men of all backgrounds, ethnicities, and races can have competence and interest in software development and deserve equal access to opportunities in open source and tech. But the low rate at which marginalized people are recruited, and the high rate at which they leave the industry, point to a larger cultural and systemic problem. Codes of conduct attempt to address this in part by reducing the potential for discrimination, explicit and implicit bias, and the negative impact of homogeneous teams.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I don’t agree with Community Workshop’s politics. Should I avoid this code of conduct?</summary>
  The code of conduct is separate from any particular politics or ideologies. It serves as a guideline for respectful behavior and sets expectations for participants in the Community Workshop. It is important to focus on the shared goal of creating an inclusive and welcoming environment rather than personal disagreements. The code of conduct does not imply any political or social orientation aside from the goal of making the project welcoming and inclusive to people of all backgrounds.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Doesn’t a code of conduct give too much power to project maintainers?</summary>
  Project maintainers are the arbiters of code of conduct violations and are the unquestioned leaders of the projects they own. Without a code of conduct, a project maintainer has the power to eject any contributor from a project for any (or no) reason at all. The codes of conduct aim to distribute the responsibility of maintaining a positive community environment among project maintainers and community leaders. While they have the authority to enforce the code, it is  done transparently and with the goal of creating a safe and inclusive space for all participants. The power is balanced with accountability and the input of the community.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I be cited for a code of conduct violation for something that I say on Twitter or other social media site?</summary>
  The code of conduct only applies in project spaces and when an individual is representing a project. However, if your behavior on external platforms has a direct and significant impact on the project or our community, it may be considered when evaluating a potential code of conduct violation. It is important to exercise respectful behavior and represent the project or community positively, even outside official spaces.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are ‘ethnicity’ and ‘race’ called out as two separate pivots? Aren’t these terms interchangeable?</summary>
Ethnicity (or ethnic group) is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestry, language, history, society, culture or nation. Race is the grouping of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society and usually resulting from genetic ancestry. 'Ethnicity' and 'race' are distinct but interconnected concepts. While they can overlap, they are not necessarily interchangeable. We recognize different cultures and the process of translation might make the differences between these terms less apparent. Violence and discrimination can occur based on the perception of either and sometimes both at the same time which is why it is important to call them out as two separate concepts.
